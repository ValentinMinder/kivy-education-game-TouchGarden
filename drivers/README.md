# Divers for EloTouch screens

Please download the latest drivers from http://support.elotouch.com/download/Drivers/DriverDownload/

WARNING: TOUCH SCREEN WILL PROBABLY WORK ON WINDOWS/LINUX WITHOUT SPECIFIC DIVERS FROM ELOTOUCH. HOWEVER, MANY OPTIONS WON'T BE AVAILABLE, LIKE NO CALIBRATION. IT IS VERY RECOMMENDED TO INSTALL ELOTOUCH DRIVERS PROPERLY.

For convenience only, today's drivers (Mars 2017) are included in this repo, because the game was tested with these on old devices. Use them only if you are having problems with the most recent drivers from EloTouch.
